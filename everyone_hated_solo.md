All of my friends hated Solo. I watched the movie twice. The first time I watched it, I didn't really enjoy the majority of the movie. 
The ending was different from other Star Wars movie endings, and I found that interesting.
It made me like the movie more, and I saw it a second time. 

Did all of your friends hate Solo?

All of my friends hated Solo as well, but I found it intersting. I have only watched the movie once.
